PHP/SWF Charts V3.x======================PHP/SWF Charts version 3.x requires a few modification to chart scripts written for version 1.x or 2.x:1. Charts are no longer generated with the DrawChart() function. Charts now have an independent source, which allows generating the data for multiple charts from one central script. This also deprecates $chart['param_file'] and removes the limit on the amount of data each chart can handle. For details on how to generate charts in version 3.x, see the tutorial on this page:http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Tutorial2. The above change deprecates $chart['param_file'] and removes the limit on the amount of data each chart can handle. Find and delete the occurrences of $chart['param_file'] in your code.3. The $chart['canvas_bg'] attributes are now passed through the new InsertChart() function. Find and delete the occurrences of $chart['canvas_bg'] in your code, and replace them with the appropriate InsertChart() parameters . See the canvas_bg reference on this page for details:http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Reference&submenu=canvas_bg4. The live_update script is now generated in the same way original charts are created. If you used the live_update feature in earlier versions, see the live_update reference on this page:http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Reference&submenu=live_update5. Find the occurrences of $chart['chart_grid'] in your code, and replace them with $chart['chart_grid_h'] and $chart['chart_grid_v']. See these page for details:http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Reference&submenu=chart_grid_hhttp://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Reference&submenu=chart_grid_v6. Find the occurrences of $chart['chart_line'] and $chart['chart_candlestick'] in your code, and replace them with $chart['chart_pref']. See this page for details:http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Reference&submenu=chart_pref Other changes in 3.x don't affect the remaining code.
