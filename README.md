# Centre/SIS Student Information System

Version 4.5.7 (2016, MySQL) and version 3.1 (2011, PostgreSQL), see branch 3.1.

Centre/SIS is considered a dead project since 2016 and 4.5.7 is the last known version.

Those versions are archived here for historical purposes.

For an up-to-date SIS based on Centre/SIS, see [RosarioSIS](https://gitlab.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis/).

Having the source code of Centre/SIS comes handy when developing RosarioSIS for 2 main reasons:

1. Check for regressions. Some code was changed in RosarioSIS and a bug is found. We can go back to Centre/SIS' original code and check the differences.

2. Check for legacy bugs. Some bug was found in RosarioSIS. We can go back to Centre/SIS' code and check if the bug has its origin there.

Consult the original [README](README).
