Centre v2.7

- Student Fields
  added 'sort order' to control display order
  changed display of fields so the various field types are displayed together
    rather than all of one type, then the next type, etc so fields of
    different types that go together can be placed together (except for long
    text fields which are still separate)
  added 'required' to colorize field titles when value is null
  added new student field types
    + auto pull-down - pull-down type that builds the select list automatically
        similar to pull-down but the select list is only the default (static)
          list, but other values used in the database are added to the list
          (dynamic) - you can enter a new value by selecting the '---' from the
          select list then editting, then the new value added to the list
    + coded pull-down - pull-down type where the values are saved as codes
  allow changing of field type between text, pull-down, and auto-pull-down

- added PrintClassLists to teacher scheduling so tachers can do their own lists

- added personalizations to standard report card comments
    + ^n = nickname if not null, else first name
    + ^s = his or her

- improved login and syear behavior
    + users can select only years where they exist
    + students can login only if currently enrolled

  semi-convenient 'if()' to force current year only if you don't want users
    and students to select previous years
