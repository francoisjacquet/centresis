Centre School Information System - NEW_IN

New in 2.7
----------

Student Fields
- Two new student field types are added.  The 'auto pull-down' is a cross
  between the 'text' and 'pull-down' types.  The defined pull-down is
  augmented with values saved in the database.  This gives the flexibility
  to enter anything yet the ease and consistency of selecting from a list.
  To enter a new value, select the '---' value from the list and Save, then
  the '---' will be edittable as regular text - change to the correct new
  value and Save again and the field is back to a pull-down and includes
  the new value.
- Sort order is added to fields and categoris to control the tab order and
  display order.
- The display of the field data on the student screens is combined instead
  of all of one type, then the next type, etc.  This allows, with the use
  of the sort order, fields of different types that are logically related
  to be located together.
- A required checkbox is added to indicate the field should be filled in.
  This does not actually -require- you to fill it in, but will highlight
  the field title in red if it is blank.

PrintClassLists
- Print class lists is available to teachers so they can generate their
  own lists.

Report Card Comments
- Personalizations are added to the standard report card comments.  The
  following translations are implemented:
  ^n = student nickname or, if null, first name
  ^s = his or her or, if null, his/her

Failed Login Counters
- Failed attempts to staff and students accounts are counted and a
  warning generated on the welcome screen if failed logins.

Portal Notes
- Admins can post messages to the welcome screen with scheduled duration
  of display and control which to which user profiles the messages are
  displayed

Users
- Added Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss title to name
