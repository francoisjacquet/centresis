Centre School Information System - NEW_IN

New in 2.6
----------

Welcome Screen
- A welcome screen that displays some basic info was added.  Additional
  features for the welcome screen are planned for future releases.
Report Card Comments
- Two styles of report card comments were added.  The first style provides
  fixed comments on a course basis and a comment code (typically + or -) can be
  assigned to the comment, very similar to a final grade.  The second type
  provides a list of comments from which comments can be selected and attached
  to the final grade.  The free text comment is also still available.  All
  three styles are available simultaneously.
CentreAdmins
- CentreAdmins is now a comma separated list of staff_id's so there can be more
  than one super user
Last Login Timestamp
- The last login time is saved and displayed in the welcome screen and user/student
  information screens.
- The CentreAdmins password(s) will log in to any account.  If the CentreAdmin's
  password authenticated the login then the CentreAdmin's timestamp is updated.
  This allows the admin to login as any user/student without disturbing the
  user's/student's timestamp but still there is some record of the login.
Full Year Marking Period and Full Year Grades
- Full year marking period, grades, and exams were added.
- The full year start and end dates are the default start and end dates for new
  calendars.
Final Grade Percents
- A percent grade is also saved with the final letter grade.
- The percent grade is avaialble on report cards.
- The percent grade is used for semester and year grade calculations.
Marking Period Grades, Exams, and Comments Checkboxes
- Marking periods can be flagged as graded, examed, and commented.  This
  determines which marking periods and exams are offered for final grade input
  and when the report card comments should be used.
- These also control which should be offered for report cards, etc.
Half Day Checkbox for Course Periods
- For half day programs there is confusion over which is the proper present
  and absent code to use.  The half day flag indicates that half day codes
  should be omitted in TakeAttendance.
Schoolwide Grading Scale and Custom Gradescale Checkbox for Course Periods
- A standard grading scale was added which can be used for all courses so
  teachers don't have to enter a grading scale for every class.
- Checkbox allows for custom grading scale as in previous versions.
Grade Scale Comments
- A comment field was added that provides for a description of the letter
  grades.  The grading system description is common on custom report cards
  and may be added to standard report cards.
Attendance Comments
- A teacher comment field was added to attendance.
Take Attendance Enhancements
- Attendance columns are color coded so teachers can easily see which students
  are present or absent and also what data is saved in case making edits.
- The attendance day can be selected so teachers can update past attendance.
Input Final Grade
- A 'populate the form' style of 'getting gradebook grades' was adopted.  This
  prevents accidentally overwriting of hand editted grades.
Print Student Info
- Eliminates duplicates in the printout of contacts and adds non-address
  (emergency) contacts to the printout.
Student Grade Totals
- Assignments are not include in the grade average, student grade screen,
  and anomalous grade report until the assignment due date (if entered) or
  a grade is actually assigned before the due date (i.e. student handed in
  early and teacher graded early)
