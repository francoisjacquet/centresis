Address Fields
Contact Fields
User Fields
- These are to addresses, contacts, and users what student fields are to students.

  Address fields extend the address data.  The advantage over just an ordinary
  student field is that address can be shared by multiple students (ganged).  So
  by using address fields in conjunction with ganged addresses you only need to
  enter and update this data once.  For example, suppose you want to include the
  county as part of the student record - all students living at the same address
  are in the same county but if you add 'County' as a student field you will have
  to enter the 'County' for each student at that address.  However, by adding
  'County' as an address field you only enter it once for the family (assuming
  the family is ganged to a single address).

  Contact fields extend the contact data.  While this is already possible with
  the existing contact information, this method is very unstructured and
  clumsy.  With contact fields you can pre-define the contact info you want
  and specify the data type.  The old-style contact information capability is also
  still available.  The variable $use_contact in modules/Students/config.inc.php
  can be set to false to disable the addition of any new old-style contact
  information (existing information will still be displayed and can be maintained,
  but the ability to add is disabled).

  User fields is similar to student fields except for users.

  Student Labels

    Note: If the search did not specify a course period then the teacher and
    room are for 'attendance' period (that is, the course schedule in the
    period with the 'Used for Attendance' box checked).
  - Student Labels are available to teachers too.
    Note: Teachers always have a course period specified (their currently
    selected course).
