Centre v2.9

- bugfix: converted AllowUse() function to positive logic (oops, forgot to do when converting
    profiles/permissions to positive logic in 2.8)
- introduced multiple gradescales
- NULL gradescale replaces courses:does_grades
- updated CHANGELOG and INSTALL with the v2.8 changes (forgot in 2.8)
- removed AllowEdit.fnc.php from top level dir (oops in 2.8)
- moved 'Recalculate Daily Attendance' to Utilities category
- bugfix: changed profile_id and comment from '2' to '3' in CreateParents.php (unsupported module)
- added $htmldocAssetsPath to config.inc.php
- added user preference to disable portal alerts
- backed out changes to DBDate from 2.8
- bugfix: Users:Preferences/StudentFields allows selection of categories not allowed by profile/permission
- bugfix: update PortalNotes.php and Portal.php for profiles/permissions changes of 2.8
- modified grade calculations to use outer joins to treat missing grades as 0 instead of excused
    tried to apply this uniformly to all grade calculations
- better handling of extra credit assignments in modules/Grades/Grades.php
- changed assignment sorting in modules/Grades/Assignments.php to the user Preferences(ASSIGNMENT_SORTING)
- changed course sorting in student grades to the school period sort order
- changed report card grade codes sorting to sort by breakoff first
- modified grade lookup in EnterEligibility.php to use id instead of title (since titles can be reused
    with multiple gradescales and _makeLetterGrade can return the id)
- PrintSchedules converted to search/select format
- bugfix: formating of new student screen
- added support for User pictures, added $UserPicturesPath variable to config.inc.php
- added rollover_id (last year's staff_id) to User's screen
- added new gradebook rounding option of 'no rounding' which is now the teacher default
  existing teachers are set to NORMAL by upgrade.sql which is old default so rounding behavior is
    unchanged for existing teachers
- added PrintSchedules to teacher menu
  upgrade adds permission for teachers already with permission to PrintClassLists
- moved PrintSchedules,PrintClasslists,PrintRequests to the top of the Scheduling/Reports menus since
    printing functions seem more used and the commonly used functions are easier to find at the top
- moved teacher gradebook configuration under Grades/Setup, seems to make more sense
- added marking period prefix to teacher / gradebook / final grade percentages so that all grades that make
    sense can be included in the full year grade (using only the marking period id is not enough to be
    unique if you want say the quarter grades to be averaged into both the semester grade and year grade)
- quarter grades added to final grde weights in teacher gradebook configuration
- final grade calculation for year and semester grades / get gradebook grades updated
- GetMp.fnc.php marking period queries combined into single unioned query
- bugfix: DOW omitted in functions/Attendance.php summation of minutes in the specified day
- warning displayed in teacher gradebook assignments if due date is earlier than assigned date
- student grade is grayed in teacher gradebook if grade is blank but assignment is not yet due
- assignments not due excluded in grade calculations
  assignments are 'due' if
        (assigned_date is null or today>=assigned_date)
    and (due_date is null      or today>=due_date)
     or a grade is entered
- in StudentGrades (parents and students view of student grades) ungraded assignments do not show up
    until the day after they are due, this gives teachers a day to grade assignments before parents
    would see them as a zero grade
