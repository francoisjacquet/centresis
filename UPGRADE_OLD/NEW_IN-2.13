Centre School Information System - NEW_IN

New in 2.13
-----------
Hidden Field Underlines
- Edittable items are dashed-underlined when using hidden fields

Export Pull-Down Type
- New type for student, address, contact, and user fields
- Similar to Pull-Down type but exported value is specified which is used when
  saving the list (nice for reports where a coded value is required for the
  report but a verbose value is desired in the stored data.  This is the dual
  of the Coded Pull-Down type.)
- Select options are specified like the Coded Pull-Down type
    value1|code1
    value2|code2
    ...
  where value is stored/displayed and code exported (but there is
    preferences option for which is exported)
  (note: Coded Pull-Downs are specified
    code1:value1
    code2|value2
    ...
  where code is stored/exported and value displayed (but there is 
    preferences option for which is exported)
  )
