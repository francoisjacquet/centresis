Centre School Information System - NEW_IN

New in 2.5.1
------------

There's not really a whole lot new in this release, mostly tweaks and bugfixes
and a few enhancements to facilitate planned features and optional modules.
There are however a few new features:

Anomalous Grades
- Provides teaches with a report of anomalous gradebook grades which include
  negative, missing, excused, and >100% grades.  The report is linked to the
  gradebook so teachers can conveniently access the suspect grade.
Student Grades
- Parents/student view of student grades was replaced with a completely new
  format.  Running averages are displayed and linked to individual assignments
  or all subjects can be expanded at once.
- Student grades include anonamous statistics in graphical form to provide
  parents and students a relative indication of the student's performance
  relative to the class for both grade averages and individual assignments.
- Student grades was added to the teacher menu so teacher can 'see' exactly
  what parents and students will see.
Search/Select Style for Report Cards, Final Grades, Transcripts
- Separates the student search criteria from the content specification for
  report cards, final grades, and transcripts.
Gradebook Grades
- Teachers can enter assignment scores as points, percents, or letter grade.
  Centre will convert the latter two to the corresponding point values.
- The 'All' display is formatted for better horizontal compactness.
- Grades >100% are highlighted in red.
- The default display is changed to 'Total' from 'All'.
- For weighted grades, the total weight is displayed and highlighted in
  red if not 100%.
Configuration
- Some previously 'hidden' features are brought out to the configuration
  options.
Centre Administrator
- One user can log in to all accounts.  This is a convenience for the admin
  who often needs to log in as other users so he doesn't have to remember
  a bunch of cryptic passwords.  In future versions the user logins are
  timestamped and logging in as the administrator in this way will update
  the admin's timestamp instead of the user,
